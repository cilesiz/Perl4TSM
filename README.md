# Perl4TSM
Perl scripts to aid in the management of IBM TSM-environments. (Currently known as IBM Spectrum Protect)

These scripts have been developed for a mixed environment of AIX and Solaris. To avoid compatibility issues I avoided enhancements like the 'defined-or' operator and all other nice features that were introduced since v5.8. Also, I could not make use of CPAN, so only core Perl here.
